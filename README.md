# Trackgenix Project
## Description
The web page belongs to the company belonging to the problem raised in these weeks, called Trackgenix. It has a home page, a section called why trackgenix, a contact form, a footer, and a sidebar, which you can go to to log in and register, as well as navigate between sections of the page. This project is fully responsive and works on any type of device, it also has a minimalist and clean aesthetic to be intuitive for the user. It has validations for the forms in addition to error messages, you can also save the data entered in the form in the browser.
It contains a folder called "views" with the HTML code of the web page, a folder called "styles", which contains the CSS code that styles the entire project, another folder called "javascript" which contains the Javascript code, which gives some interactive functionalities to the project. Also a folder called "assets" that contains the images and icons of the project.
