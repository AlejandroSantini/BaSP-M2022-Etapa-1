# Trackgenix Project
## Description
It contains an index.html file with the HTML code of the main web page of the company belonging to the problem raised in these weeks, called Trackgenix. It has a homepage, a section called why trackgenix, a contact form, a footer and a lateral sidebar. In addition, a file called style.css, which contains the CSS code, which styles the entire project (And a reset.css file in charge of removing the default properties of the browser). As well as a folder called img, which contains the images of the project.

### Week 02
I made the code in HTML based on the screenshot in the figure.
### Week 03
Apply CSS to the Week 02 code to style it, without using flexfox and using the figma screenshot as our guide.

```
### Requirements
